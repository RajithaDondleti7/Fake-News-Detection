Royal Mail: What made a billionaire want to buy this fading relic,"From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution? ""A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please."" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands. The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot. He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth £6bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets. Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail. His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe. But six months on, his bid to buy Royal Mail's parent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed ""legally binding"" undertakings.  It was agreed that the government would retain a so-called ""golden share"", requiring it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions. Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way. But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic? Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door. But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes. Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.  In December 2024, it was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail. While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share. Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of £3.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap. At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than £6bn but had slumped to just over £2bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.  He sealed the deal at £3.6bn - 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago. ""Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,"" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. ""It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal. ""This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff."" Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International. Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do. ""Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,"" says Ms King. Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed him to buy a 27.5% stake in Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company – EP Group – intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics. He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon. The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail £300m a year – putting it back on a break-even footing. Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO ""as long as I am alive"", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that ""rational minds prevail"" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form. So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were ""real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future"". Given letter numbers are falling, ""we have to think about what is economical"", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail ""to make sure it is sustainable"". While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements. Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets – 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five – is ""over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service"". It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies ""goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation"". But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business. Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 – long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.  Last year GLS made a profit of £320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost £348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business. ""GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,"" says Mr Paterson. Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be ""nonsensical"". In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations. What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL. Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors? Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly. Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense. Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe. Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst. Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box. Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an ""historic change"" to give postboxes ""a new lease of life"". All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time. ""If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,"" says Mr Paterson. ""There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries."" But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK. That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws. Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe – paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders. Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a ""legitimate business figure"" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago. Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. ""The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,"" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. ""We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor."" But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU. Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years. Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky ""couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years"". So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice? The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not. The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.

Two British tourists drown near Australia's Great Barrier Reef,"Two British tourists have drowned off the coast of a popular tourist town at the southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef. A boy, 17, and a man, 46, were swept out to sea on Sunday while swimming at a beach without lifeguards in Seventeen Seventy - a town in Queensland named for the year Captain James Cook arrived in Australia. The pair were declared dead at the scene after being pulled from the water by a police rescue helicopter. An Australian man is also in a life-threatening condition after being swept out to sea, and was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries. While police revealed that the deceased were from the UK, their names have not yet been released. ""Sunday's mission was a difficult one,"" CapRescue, the emergency rescue service that found the three men, shared on social media - adding that the deaths had occurred ""despite the best efforts of all involved"". Police say the injured Australian man was from Monto, a town about 150 kilometres inland from Seventeen Seventy. ""We're not sure whether the third person jumped into the water trying to perform a rescue,"" Surf Life Saving Queensland's Darren Everard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). There is only one beach patrolled by lifeguards within a 50-kilometre radius of Seventeen Seventy. Police are treating the drownings as non-suspicious and will prepare a report for the coroner. One-hundred-and-seven people drowned in Australia last year, with 25% of them born overseas, according to Royal Life Saving Australia. Australia's coastal fatalities mostly occur around creeks and headlands at high tide when ""it's chaos in the water"", Everard explained. Speaking to ABC, he encouraged tourists to ""seek local knowledge"" and swim between the flags. The BBC spoke to people in Sydney about Australia's housing crisis and what they'd like to see politicians to do help. Two people, including a teenager, were arrested after the nine-year-old was shot on a farm on Sunday. Australia's housing crisis has hit its worst point in decades, becoming a key issue in the upcoming election. It is the latest repatriation of First Nations remains by London's Natural History Museum.

"North Korea is making what could be its largest, most advanced warship ever, new satellite photos show | CNN","Follow: 
            New satellite images show what could be North Korea’s biggest warship ever – possibly more than double the size of anything in leader Kim Jong Un’s naval fleet.
     
            Images taken by independent satellite providers Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs on April 6 show the ship under construction in the water at the Nampo shipyard on North Korea’s west coast, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital Pyongyang.
     
            Analysts say the pictures show ongoing construction of weapons and other internal systems of the ship, which is likely a guided-missile frigate (FFG) designed to carry missiles in vertical launch tubes for use against targets on land and sea.
     
            “The FFG is approximately 140 meters (459 feet) long, making it the largest warship manufactured in North Korea,” an analysis by Joseph Bermudez Jr. and Jennifer Jun at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said.
     
            For comparison, the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are about 505 feet long and its under-construction Constellation-class frigates will be 496 feet long.
     
            The existence of the warship is not a surprise.
     
            The Kim regime has been engaged in a rapid modernization of its armed forces, developing a range of new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States.
     
            It’s done that despite United Nations sanctions that have puts strict limits on its access to the materials and technology to develop those weapons.
     
            But the closer ties with Russia since the beginning of the Ukraine war could be helping North Korea overcome the UN sanctions, analysts say.
     
            Kim Duk-ki, a retired South Korean admiral, said he thinks Moscow may be providing the technology for the frigate’s missile systems.
     
            Pictures of the vessel appeared in a report by state-run Korean Central Television released late last year on the ruling Workers’ Party’s end-of-year plenary session. The images showed leader Kim inspecting the ship’s construction.
     
            The images in the KCTV video show the warship could have the kind of weaponry possessed by modern navies, including vertical launch cells that could be used to fire a variety of missiles.
     
            Analysts also noted the ship seems to be set up to have phased-array radar, which can track threats and targets more quickly and accurately than previously displayed North Korean capabilities.
     
            Despite those indications of advanced warfighting abilities, analysts urged caution in making assumptions.
     
            Almost any shipbuilder can get the hull and propulsion systems right, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and Hawaii-based analyst.
     
            “However, modern warships represent an integration challenge of communications, electronics, weapons, and both electronic and acoustic sensor technologies” that is not so easily achieved, he said.
     
            In an interview with CNN in March, South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee, a member of the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee, questioned whether Pyongyang has the technical ability to build an advanced warship, or the infrastructure to support it.
     
            “Operating such a big military warship takes significant amount of budget. They not only have to build a warship, but make a team that would operate it, and it costs to operate it including the equipment and fuel. Also, one huge warship cannot go out on its own. So the question is, can North Korea afford the cost?” he said.
     
            Kim, the retired South Korean admiral, was cautious on not underestimating what the final product may look like, especially its lethality.

Nisha Rawal slams trolls over nasty comments on viral video with son: ‘Sharam aani chahiye logon ko’ - Hindustan Times," Television actor Nisha Rawal’s video with her son Kavish from Sara Arfeen’s Iftaar party recently surfaced on the internet. In the video, Kavish was seen kissing his mother’s chest while they posed for the paparazzi, which invited nasty comments from social media users. In a conversation with Instant Bollywood, Nisha gave a fitting reply to the trolls. (Also Read: Nisha Rawal accepts she has bipolar disorder: 'But I am not a psycho. I am not ashamed about it') During the Bombay Times Fashion Week in Mumbai, Nisha was asked about the comments regarding the video with her son. She responded, ""Sharam aani chahiye un logon ko jo ek maa-bete ke relationship ko uss nazariye se dekhte hain. Yeh khot unke mann mein hai, so no more comments on that. Uss baare mein kya hi bol sakte hai? (People who view a mother-son relationship in that way should be ashamed. That negativity is in their minds, so there’s nothing more to say about it. What more can be said on the matter?)""  Nisha was married to actor Karan Mehra for over nine years. However, in 2021, she accused him of physical violence, leading to Karan’s arrest on charges of assault. He was later released on bail after spending a few hours in jail. Karan then accused Nisha of having an extramarital affair. Nisha is now raising her son alone. Speaking to Pinkvilla, Nisha said she is taking all possible steps to ensure a healthy upbringing for Kavish amidst the ongoing conflict with Karan. She shared that she regularly consults therapists for guidance. “Before calling up the therapists, I check with his paediatrician if he’s in any kind of trauma or pain that I need to be aware of. He did not witness any of the major fights, but yes, he did see a bit of our banter. So, the vibes are there in the air, and the child is absorbing them. I really wanted to get into the skin of those feelings and make sure he doesn’t struggle, because this is also his story,” she said. Nisha Rawal began her acting journey in 2001 with the show Aane Wala Pal. However, she rose to fame with her role in the TV show Main Lakshmi Tere Aangan Ki. She later participated in the dance reality show Nach Baliye and appeared in other shows like Shaadi Mubarak and Meet: Badlegi Duniya Ki Reet. She was last seen in Kangana Ranaut’s reality show Lock Upp, which was won by Munawar Faruqui.   ",Real

"North Korea is making what could be its largest, most advanced warship ever, new satellite photos show | CNN"," New satellite images show what could be North Korea’s biggest warship ever – possibly more than double the size of anything in leader Kim Jong Un’s naval fleet. Images taken by independent satellite providers Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs on April 6 show the ship under construction in the water at the Nampo shipyard on North Korea’s west coast, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of the capital Pyongyang. Analysts say the pictures show ongoing construction of weapons and other internal systems of the ship, which is likely a guided-missile frigate (FFG) designed to carry missiles in vertical launch tubes for use against targets on land and sea. “The FFG is approximately 140 meters (459 feet) long, making it the largest warship manufactured in North Korea,” an analysis by Joseph Bermudez Jr. and Jennifer Jun at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said. For comparison, the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke-class destroyers are about 505 feet long and its under-construction Constellation-class frigates will be 496 feet long. The existence of the warship is not a surprise. The Kim regime has been engaged in a rapid modernization of its armed forces, developing a range of new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach almost anywhere in the United States. It’s done that despite United Nations sanctions that have puts strict limits on its access to the materials and technology to develop those weapons. But the closer ties with Russia since the beginning of the Ukraine war could be helping North Korea overcome the UN sanctions, analysts say. Kim Duk-ki, a retired South Korean admiral, said he thinks Moscow may be providing the technology for the frigate’s missile systems. Pictures of the vessel appeared in a report by state-run Korean Central Television released late last year on the ruling Workers’ Party’s end-of-year plenary session. The images showed leader Kim inspecting the ship’s construction. The images in the KCTV video show the warship could have the kind of weaponry possessed by modern navies, including vertical launch cells that could be used to fire a variety of missiles. Analysts also noted the ship seems to be set up to have phased-array radar, which can track threats and targets more quickly and accurately than previously displayed North Korean capabilities. Despite those indications of advanced warfighting abilities, analysts urged caution in making assumptions. Almost any shipbuilder can get the hull and propulsion systems right, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and Hawaii-based analyst. “However, modern warships represent an integration challenge of communications, electronics, weapons, and both electronic and acoustic sensor technologies” that is not so easily achieved, he said. In an interview with CNN in March, South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee, a member of the National Assembly’s Intelligence Committee, questioned whether Pyongyang has the technical ability to build an advanced warship, or the infrastructure to support it. “Operating such a big military warship takes significant amount of budget. They not only have to build a warship, but make a team that would operate it, and it costs to operate it including the equipment and fuel. Also, one huge warship cannot go out on its own. So the question is, can North Korea afford the cost?” he said. Kim, the retired South Korean admiral, was cautious on not underestimating what the final product may look like, especially its lethality. “If North Korea equips the new frigate with the hypersonic ballistic missile it claimed to have successfully tested in January, that will cause a game changing impact in the regional security,” the former naval officer said. After reviewing the satellite images for CNN, Schuster said it’s likely a year or more of work remains before the new North Korean warship can begin sea trials. “This ship’s construction is being delayed by the lack of the superstructure, sensor and weapons systems intended for installation,” he said.

Two British tourists drown near Australia's Great Barrier Reef,"Two British tourists have drowned off the coast of a popular tourist town at the southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef. A boy, 17, and a man, 46, were swept out to sea on Sunday while swimming at a beach without lifeguards in Seventeen Seventy - a town in Queensland named for the year Captain James Cook arrived in Australia. The pair were declared dead at the scene after being pulled from the water by a police rescue helicopter. An Australian man is also in a life-threatening condition after being swept out to sea, and was airlifted to hospital with serious head injuries. While police revealed that the deceased were from the UK, their names have not yet been released. ""Sunday's mission was a difficult one,"" CapRescue, the emergency rescue service that found the three men, shared on social media - adding that the deaths had occurred ""despite the best efforts of all involved"". Police say the injured Australian man was from Monto, a town about 150 kilometres inland from Seventeen Seventy. ""We're not sure whether the third person jumped into the water trying to perform a rescue,"" Surf Life Saving Queensland's Darren Everard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). There is only one beach patrolled by lifeguards within a 50-kilometre radius of Seventeen Seventy. Police are treating the drownings as non-suspicious and will prepare a report for the coroner. One-hundred-and-seven people drowned in Australia last year, with 25% of them born overseas, according to Royal Life Saving Australia. Australia's coastal fatalities mostly occur around creeks and headlands at high tide when ""it's chaos in the water"", Everard explained. Speaking to ABC, he encouraged tourists to ""seek local knowledge"" and swim between the flags. The BBC spoke to people in Sydney about Australia's housing crisis and what they'd like to see politicians to do help. Two people, including a teenager, were arrested after the nine-year-old was shot on a farm on Sunday. Australia's housing crisis has hit its worst point in decades, becoming a key issue in the upcoming election.

"Mehul Choksi wanted to flee to Switzerland, but India foiled his plan: Report | Latest News India - Hindustan Times"," Fugitive diamond trader Mehul Choksi, wanted in India in connection with the ₹13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, was arrested by Belgian police over the weekend, just as he was reportedly preparing to flee to Switzerland under the guise of seeking medical treatment. The arrest marks a major breakthrough in a relentless seven-year pursuit by Indian authorities across three countries. Choksi, the owner of the Gitanjali Group and a central figure in one of India's largest bank frauds, had fled the country in 2018 along with his nephew Nirav Modi, his wife Ami Modi, and brother Neeshal Modi. Soon after, he acquired Antiguan citizenship through its investment program, complicating India's attempts to bring him to justice. His arrest in Belgium follows a covert operation by Indian agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), who had been tracking his movements across the globe. Belgian police acted swiftly on inputs provided by Indian officials after it became clear Choksi was attempting to flee to Switzerland for cancer treatment at the Hirslanden Klinik Aarau, reports India Today citing sources. Choksi had obtained an F residency card from Belgium in November last year by using forged documents, allegedly involving his wife Preeti Choksi, a Belgian national. He falsely cited humanitarian grounds and critical medical conditions to gain the residency, all while concealing his dual citizenship status - he remains both an Indian and Antiguan citizen. Indian officials moved fast when they discovered that Choksi had applied for an upgrade to an F+ residency card, which would have made extradition significantly more challenging. In response, Belgian authorities suspended the conversion process and arrested Choksi in Antwerp on the basis of two non-bailable warrants issued by a Mumbai court in 2018 and 2021. Currently lodged in a Belgian jail, Choksi’s bail hearing is expected to take place after a week. His lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, confirmed the arrest and said legal efforts are underway to secure his release. ""We will be starting the process of filing an appeal against this, and then... we will be requesting that he be pulled out of prison,"" said Aggarwal, citing Choksi’s poor health and cancer treatment as grounds for relief. This is not Choksi’s first run-in with international law enforcement. In 2021, he was arrested in the Dominican Republic for illegal entry, triggering a dramatic sequence of legal battles. A CBI team was dispatched to secure his extradition, but his lawyers successfully argued for his return to Antigua for medical reasons. The British Queen’s Privy Council later ruled in his favor, and he was flown back to Antigua after spending 51 days in jail. Despite multiple setbacks, Indian authorities persisted. They learned of Choksi’s presence in Belgium last year and promptly alerted local agencies, sharing a comprehensive dossier detailing his role in the massive bank fraud. Belgian police arrested him shortly afterward, preventing what would have been another escape - this time to Switzerland. Choksi had previously offered to cooperate with Indian agencies via video conferencing, citing his health and inability to travel. However, this proposal was rejected. With his latest arrest, India appears to be inching closer to bringing the fugitive businessman back to face trial on home soil. The ED and CBI are now preparing to initiate formal extradition proceedings in Belgium.   ",Real

Analysis: Trump calls Sumy missile strike a ‘mistake.’ But Russia’s war seems to be raging on exactly to Putin’s plan | CNN," “I was told they made a mistake.” This is the way US President Donald Trump characterized Russia’s “horrific” double-tap missile strike on central Sumy, Ukraine, on Saturday, which allegedly used cluster munitions to maximize casualties. The Iskander missiles reportedly utilized are accurate, and the use of two of them could suggest a degree of purpose and malice, aimed at hitting first responders too as they rush in. It is unlikely the Kremlin saw the error of its ways - this tactic being now so common - and perhaps a sympathizer is instead excusing Russia to the US president. The weekend’s strike was, to Ukraine’s allies, a gruesome reminder of Moscow’s true intent in its invasion: to terrify Ukrainians into submission. The target, Sumy, is also in Russia’s immediate crosshairs, as President Vladimir Putin claims to seek a buffer zone inside of Ukraine by pounding this thriving border city. RELATED ARTICLE
‘This isn’t Russia, never was, and never will be’: Ukrainians living under occupation fear Trump’s peace talks The attack also placed unwelcome emphasis on just how little fruit the White House’s relentless pursuit of diplomacy has borne. Trump said Friday on social media that Russia had to “get moving,” but provided no deadlines or explicit consequences if it did not, although secondary tariffs on its oil purchasers have been floated. Trump has made similar comments before – admonishing Moscow for its onslaught on Ukraine’s civilians, while also expressing broader grief at the tragedy of war in general, rather than fury at the Kremlin’s specific massacres, say of nine children at a Kryvyi Rih playground days earlier. The truth Trump may be reluctant to post about is that Russia’s diplomacy has predictably dissolved into a dizzying Catherine wheel of tangents. It generates the requisite light and noise, but is of little consequence, bar Moscow continuing to buy time and prosecute the war on its own terms. American and Russian diplomats are now on a carousel of Moscow’s apparent design, with multiple tracks leaving scant chance of real progress. Trump’s foreign envoy Steve Witkoff intermittently flies to Russia, to presumably hear demands direct from the Kremlin, whose official called his Friday visit to St Petersburg “productive.” Higher-level American and Russian diplomats meet in Saudi Arabia to float ceasefire ideas and a wider detente, while lower-level diplomatic meetings began in the new venue of Turkey last week to address the technical details of embassies reopening. And there is more. The Americans and Ukrainians have been hammering out in Washington a viable way forward from a dense and corporate rare-earth minerals contract, drawn up (and perhaps only understood) by Delaware corporate lawyers, which seems, according to the last draft seen by CNN, to be almost entirely in the White House’s favor. And there is a separate diplomatic US-Ukraine track over peace, also in Saudi Arabia, that has so far proposed a wide-ranging ceasefire that Russia has yet to agree to. Instead, a limited 30-day energy infrastructure ceasefire – chaotically birthed and barely adhered to – ends on Friday. This first test of diplomacy, seemingly dead on arrival, is somehow yet to cast future endeavors as problematic. RELATED ARTICLE
Ukraine’s European allies say Russian aggression is pushing peace out of reach, as US envoy meets Putin The above flow chart, or lapsed Venn diagram, has the singular unifying thread of the Trump administration seeking progress from multiple different dialogues it hopes will eventually congeal into a singular lasting peace. Five different, current conversations, and that is even if you don’t count the mostly silent role of Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia Gen. Keith Kellogg, or the intermittent but overarching influence that Putin-Trump phone calls take. This disparate and confusing interface is, Moscow’s critics say, a standard Russian tactic to buy time while appearing engaged. The Trump administration brimmed with 24-hour to 100-day deadlines about peace prior to the rubber hitting the road. Now there is no deadline – or end to the metastasizing talks – in sight. Why does Putin seek time? Because he believes Trump has been proven to be easily distracted and is interested in an easy win, but not a complex compromise. Putin also clearly believes this summer he can win a tangible victory on the front lines that will change the dynamic in talks. His onslaught on Sumy is intended to buy Russia space on the border, but also drag Ukraine’s forces in. Russia is making slow yet discomforting progress to the south of Zaporizhzhia, an area where nearly two years ago its counteroffensive was meant to have broken through. One Ukrainian intelligence officer recently moved to near the city of Kharkiv described a front line quieter than expected, and anxiety as to what lies ahead. Concerns are growing that Russia is amassing reinforcements, waiting for the ground to dry in May to escalate a spring offensive that Ukrainian officials say has already partially begun. Kyiv has hinted at an artillery ammunition shortage in the weeks ahead, and recent pledges by its allies may not have headed off that imminent crisis. It is going to be a very difficult summer for Ukraine. This is the real rubber hitting the road. Moscow has invested all in a war in which it simply cannot afford anything less than victory. It does not see gain in forging a deal over frozen front lines now. The momentum – with a White House tearing up economic and security norms by the sheaf, and Ukraine struggling to meet manpower and resource needs – is day by day more in its favor. The Russians are stalling for time as they believe it is on their side. Their European allies are disconcertingly readying for two unpleasant potential futures. The first is the possibility of a Ukrainian collapse and the need for NATO’s European members to hold back the Russians without American assistance. This is a more remote likelihood, but the undertone of preparations across the continent. The second possibility is more feasible and public: the British and French are spearheading preparations for a “reassurance force” to protect any ceasefire. The noise, and planning, serves two purposes: it allows Kyiv to agree to diplomacy knowing it has some security guarantees in place. And it partially embarrasses Moscow into stonewalling a peace plan that is increasingly ready to roll. But with each rotation of the diplomatic Catherine wheel, the terms of actual peace become more dizzying. Putin seems less willing to offer even a partial pause as he believes ultimately Trump is toothless and will not punish him effectively for refusing this détente. Trump said of US talks with Russia and Ukraine at the weekend: “You know, there’s a point at which you have to either put up or shut up.” His problem is that both he and the Kremlin are happy to keep talking. And neither wants to put up either: Trump is reluctant to impose harsh sanctions and disrupt his relationship with Moscow, and the Kremlin seems to have no desire to stop the war. Trump added: “We’ll see what happens, but I think it’s going fine.” Ukraine must be left hoping he does not mean simply that the country’s fate will be permanently eclipsed by another crisis. © 2025 Cable News Network.

"After Murshidabad, violence erupts in Bengal's South 24 Parganas over Waqf Amendment Act | Latest News India - Hindustan Times"," After Murshidabad, violent clashes broke out in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas after supporters of the Indian Secular Front (ISF) clashed with the police during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. The clashes, which erupted in South 24 Parganas' Bhangar on Monday, led to several injuries and the torching of multiple police vehicles, PTI reported.  Later, West Bengal police assured that situation in Bhangar was brought under control and cases were registered against the micreats involved in damaging the property. “The public is advised not to heed rumours. Stringent legal action will also be taken against those found spreading misinformation,” Kolkata police said in a tweet. The unrest began when police stopped ISF supporters from heading towards Ramlila Maidan in central Kolkata to attend an anti-Waqf (Amendment) Act rally addressed by party leader and Bhangar MLA Naushad Siddique. According to police sources, the protestors were stopped near Bhojerhat on the Basanti Highway, where a large number of ISF workers had gathered from Bhangar as well as neighbouring areas such as Minakhan and Sandeshkhali, the news agency reported. Tension escalated when the crowd attempted to break through police barricades, leading to a clash between the two sides. ""Some police vehicles were set on fire by the protesters, and a few police personnel were injured when the agitators attacked the law enforcers,"" a senior police officer said. The confrontation brought traffic to a standstill along the highway, as ISF supporters sat on the road in protest. A large police force, including senior officers, was deployed to bring the situation under control. A high alert was sounded in the nearby areas. The protesters were later dispersed According to eyewitnesses, police resorted to a lathi-charge to disperse the protesters, as the rally at Ramlila Ground didn't have proper police permission, a PTI report said. However, despite the violence, Siddique addressed the gathering at Ramlila Maidan, slamming the Waqf (Amendment) Act and demanding its immediate withdrawal. ""This law is not just an attack on Muslims, it is an assault on the Constitution. We won't accept this Act. The government that supports such laws must go,"" he said. Also Read | Hundreds flee violence-hit Murshidabad, take shelter in Malda ISF also accused the BJP of trying to incite communal tension and the ruling Trinamool Congress of suppressing opposition protests. ""The chief minister has said the new Waqf law will not be implemented in West Bengal. We welcome that. But then why are police stopping our workers from attending a peaceful rally? Does the right to protest belong only to the Trinamool Congress?"" he asked. Communal violence also took place in parts of Murshidabad, including Suti, Dhulian, and Jangipur, on Friday and Saturday during protests over the Waqf (Amendment) Act. The violence left three people dead.

JD Vance to arrive in Delhi today amid global tariff war | What's on agenda | Latest News India - Hindustan Times," US Vice President JD Vance on Monday will arrive in New Delhi, kickstarting his four-day visit to India as both the countries seek to unlock economic opportunities and negotiate a bilateral trade deal. Vance will be accompanied by his wife Usha, their children and other senior members of the U.S. administration. The couple will visit Jaipur and Agra and participate in engagements at cultural sites. Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. Both the leaders are expected to hold talks on economy, trade and geopolitical ties. The US vice president's visit to India is being seen as an important diplomatic mission by the Donald Trump administration, coinciding with a rapidly intensifying trade war between US and China.

The US is also India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion until recently. ALSO READ: PM Modi meets JD Vance at Elysee Palace, congratulates him on ‘great victory’ “The visit will provide an opportunity for both sides to review the progress in bilateral relations and the implementation of the outcomes of the India-U.S. Joint Statement issued on 13 February 2025 during the visit of the Prime Minister to the US. The two sides will also exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,” the Ministry of External Affairs had said in a statement on April 16. Vance's visit to India comes weeks after Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was in India for a geopolitical conference and two months after PM Modi met Trump in Washington. Prime Minister Modi was among the first leaders to visit the US and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, the prime minister hailed a “mega partnership” with the US and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimise the possible fallout of Trump’s tariffs after it had already cut tariffs on a range of US goods. Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy as part of his now-paused tariff programme, which has provided temporary relief for Indian exporters. During his visit, Modi sought to soften impending trade barriers by saying he was open to reducing more tariffs on U.S. goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military gear. The two countries also agreed to start talks towards clinching the bilateral trade agreement.

Ukraine reports many Russian drone attacks after truce ends,"Ukraine's military has reported Russian drone attacks on several regions overnight, just hours after the end of a 30-hour ""Easter truce"" declared by Moscow. Ukraine's air force issued raid alerts for the Kyiv region, as well as Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said ""explosions were heard"". It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Russia's military has not commented on the reported attacks. The truce declared by President Vladimir Putin expired at midnight Sunday Moscow time (21:00 GMT). Both sides accused each other of violating the ceasefire. In the early hours of Monday, residents in several Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, were urged by local authorities to go immediately to nearby shelters due to the threat of drone strikes. The BBC has not independently verified the claims by Kyiv and Moscow. US President Donald Trump - who has been pushing for an end to the war - said late on Sunday that ""hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week"". He gave no further details. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and currently controls about 20% Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since 2022. Last month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.   Kyiv reports many cases of Russian shelling, while Moscow speaks of Ukrainian drone attacks during a truce that has now expired. The missions are part of the UK's contribution to Nato's enhanced air policing around eastern Poland. Oscar Jenkins has been charged under Russian law, the prosecutor in the occupied Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine said. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour truce, but it comes as diplomatic efforts pick up, Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg writes.

Hegseth shared detailed military plans in second Signal chat that included his wife and brother | CNN Politics," Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed plans about a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen on a second Signal group chat, this one on his personal phone and including his wife, lawyer and brother, three people familiar with the chat told CNN. The chat was set up during Hegseth’s tumultuous confirmation hearing process as a way for his closest allies to strategize, two of the people familiar with the matter said. But Hegseth continued using the chat, which had more than a dozen people in it, to communicate after he was confirmed, the people said. The revelation comes as some of Hegseth’s closest advisers have begun sounding the alarm about the secretary’s judgment, including his former press secretary, John Ullyot, and three former senior officials Hegseth fired last week — his top adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, who served as chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense. RELATED LIVE-STORY
Trump’s presidency: Immigration crackdown draws legal battles “It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon. From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership,” Ullyot said in a statement obtained by CNN. The second Signal chat is in addition to the one Hegseth used to communicate with Cabinet officials last month about military plans. That chat is under investigation by the Defense Department’s acting inspector general. Similar to the first Signal chat, which was revealed publicly by The Atlantic after its editor was mistakenly included by national security adviser Mike Waltz, the military plans Hegseth shared in the second chat were about strikes against the Houthis, the people said. Hegseth’s brother Phil, as well as his lawyer Tim Parlatore, both have jobs at the Department of Defense. But his wife, Jennifer, does not, despite Hegseth regularly including her during the beginning of his tenure in meetings with foreign leaders. It is not clear whether everyone in the second Signal chat has a security clearance. A spokesperson for the Pentagon, Sean Parnell, said in a tweet Sunday night that “there was no classified information in any Signal chat.” The New York Times was first to report on the second Signal chat. News of the second chat follows days of turmoil at the Defense Department, after Hegseth fired Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll and reassigned his chief of staff, Joe Kasper. Last week, Pentagon spokespeople said the chaos had resulted from a leak investigation. But sources told CNN the firings are just one symptom of the dysfunction that has enveloped Hegseth’s office over the last five weeks, which included sustained infighting between Kasper, Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll. Kasper resigned from his role last week, though he may still be reassigned elsewhere in the Pentagon. He did not respond to requests for comment. A series of leaks about military planning for the Panama Canal and the Middle East, about a possible consolidation of the combatant commands, and about a classified China briefing for Elon Musk at the Pentagon had deeply rattled Hegseth by mid-March, sources told CNN. So he and Kasper launched a leak probe, complete with polygraph tests. Following the press reports — including one in The New York Times about the questionable success of a massive military campaign against the Houthis — Hegseth began to lash out and grew suspicious that senior military officials, as well as some of his closest advisers, were leaking to undermine him, the sources added. FIRST SIGNAL CHAT
White House closes case on Signal and stands by Waltz, with key questions still unanswered At one point, Hegseth even demanded an FBI probe into the leaks — which some of his aides advised against, sources said. There was already an active inspector general investigation focusing on Hegseth, and bringing in the FBI might only invite more scrutiny, those aides advised. Hegseth has also grown increasingly concerned about the inspector general investigation, the sources said. Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll expect to be interviewed as part of that probe, the sources added. Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll wrote Saturday in a joint statement that they are “incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended” and denied leaking information. “Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door. All three of us served our country honorably in uniform — for two of us, this included deployments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, based on our collective service, we understand the importance of information security and worked every day to protect it,” they wrote. “At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with.” Ullyot, who served as Hegseth’s press secretary until earlier this month and resigned from the Defense Department entirely last week, also said Sunday it is “not true” that Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll were fired for leaking sensitive information. “While the Department said that it would conduct polygraph tests as part of the probe, not one of three has been given a lie detector test,” Ullyot said. “In fact, at least one of the three has told former colleagues straight out that investigators advised him he was about to be cleared officially of any wrongdoing. Unfortunately, Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.” RELATED ARTICLE
For now, Pentagon and DHS won’t recommend that Trump invoke the Insurrection Act The turmoil has raised more concerns about Hegseth’s judgment and priorities among current and former officials, and comes as the Pentagon is executing a major military operation in the Middle East against the Houthis, moving assets to the region in the event of a wider war between Israel and Iran, and surging troops and equipment to the southern border. “Unfortunately, after a terrible month, the Pentagon focus is no longer on warfighting, but on endless drama,” Ullyot said. “Even strong backers of the secretary like me must admit: The last month has been a full-blown meltdown at the Pentagon — and it’s becoming a real problem for the administration,” he said. Hegseth, for his part, has still not weighed in on the firings or turmoil inside his office and has avoided situations over the last week in which he may have encountered the press. Reporters were invited to cover the defense secretary welcoming his French counterpart to the Pentagon on Thursday, but Hegseth failed to show up, sending an aide instead.

"Wife Threw Chilli Powder At Ex Top Cop, Tied Him Up, Stabbed Him: Sources","Former Karnataka Police chief Om Prakash, who was found dead at his Bengaluru home yesterday, fought with his wife Pallavi in the afternoon. During this fight, she allegedly threw chilli powder at him, tied him up and then stabbed him to death, sources have said. The 68-year-old was also attacked with a glass bottle. After the murder, the retired officer's wife spoke to the wife of another cop and told her that she had killed her husband, the sources said. This led to police rushing to the crime spot and detaining Pallavi and their daughter. The mother and daughter have now been questioned for about 12 hours. The wife Pallavi, according to sources, is the prime suspect in the shocking murder of the former police chief. Om Prakash's body has multiple stab wounds on the abdomen and chest. According to reports, Om Prakash and Pallavi had an altercation over property he had transferred to a relative. This quarrel turned physical and she is suspected of having stabbed him.

Ukraine's air force also reported a ""rocket danger"" for central regions, and said that Russia's aviation was ""active in the north-eastern and eastern directions"". Several hours before the truce expired, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had not given an order to extend it, Russia's state-run news agency Tass reported. The BBC has not independently verified the claims by Ukraine and Russia.

At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions."" However, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said late on Sunday that there was a total of 1,882 cases of Russian shelling, 812 of which involved heavy weaponry, according to a report from Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi. The president said the heaviest shelling and assaults were in eastern Ukraine near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. ""The nature of Ukrainian actions will continue to be mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, our strikes will be to protect against Russian strikes,"" Zelensky said. Earlier on Sunday, he said that ""there were no air raid alerts today"", referring to Russia's daily drone and missile strikes against Ukraine. He proposed ""to cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days, with the possibility of extension"". Zelensky also said Putin's declaration of a truce amounted to a ""PR"" exercise and his words were ""empty"". He accused the Kremlin of trying to create ""a general impression of a ceasefire"". ""This Easter has clearly demonstrated that the only source of this war, and the reason it drags on, is Russia,"" the president said. The Russian defence ministry insisted its troops had ""strictly observed the ceasefire"". Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of using US-supplied Himars missiles during the ceasefire. The surprise ceasefire announcement came shortly after US Trump threatened to ""take a pass"" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine peace talks. However, a state department spokesperson said on Sunday that Washington remained ""committed to achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire"". ""It is long past time to stop the death and destruction and end this war,"" the spokesperson added.

Gaurav Khanna admits to having ‘altercations’ with Rupali Ganguly on Anupamaa's set: ‘Won’t call her a friend' - Hindustan Times," Anupamaa continues to be one of the most-loved television shows. Gaurav Khanna, who played the role of Anuj Kapadia, impressed fans with his chemistry with Rupali Ganguly. However, when he left the show, rumours circulated about a fallout between Gaurav and Rupali. Now, in an interview with Siddharth Kannan, the actor has opened up about his equation with Rupali and admitted to having altercations on set. (Also Read: Celebrity Masterchef winner is Gaurav Khanna; actor dedicates his win to all the ‘misfits’) When asked if actors were leaving the show because of Rupali, Gaurav explained that a sane-minded person, who had gained significant fame from the show, would never leave it just because of another individual. He further stated that Rupali is a fantastic co-star and one of his favourite co-actors, as he learnt a lot from her. He spoke about his relationship with the actress and said, ""Main Rupali ko friend nahi bolunga (I won't call her a friend). Rupali is a wonderful human being from whom I've learnt a lot. Friend kya hota hai ki main kabhi bhi phone kardu ki ye hai, woh hai... (A friend is someone you can call anytime and share everything), I'm not on those terms with anyone, be it Rupali or even Sudhanshu. Even Sudhanshu Ji bolna chahiye (I should say Sudhanshu Ji). He's very spiritual, like me. He's a fantastic singer. I'm very happy he's coming out with new songs. I used to say, 'Don't quit singing, please'.""   He admitted to having altercations on set and said, ""Altercations hote the scenes ko leke because everyone comes with their own idea, and I respect that — because she, being a senior actor, carries the show on her shoulders. She's the face on the poster; she is Anupamaa. So if I insist that scenes be done according to me, that would be wrong — and I’ve never done that. Altercations hote the ki like isko aise kar lete hai, woh bolenge aise kar lete hai (There used to be altercations over scenes because everyone has their own interpretation. She’s the lead, so if I push for my version, I’d be in the wrong)."" Produced by Rajan Shahi and Deepa Shahi under the banner of Director's Kut Productions, the show has become a fan favourite over the years. Led by Rupali Ganguly, who plays the titular role, the show also stars Adrija Roy (replacing Alisha Parveen Khan) and Shivam Khajuria as second-generation leads. Meanwhile, Gaurav recently participated in the reality cooking show Celebrity MasterChef. He competed with Tejasswi Prakash, Nikki Tamboli, Faisal Sheikh and Rajiv Adatia for the trophy.
